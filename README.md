# Smart Lamp

I built a smart lamp that I can control from my iPhone over WiFi.
For the lamp's body I plan to use a combination of a 3D printed parts and textile I will sew on my Чайка (Chaika) sewing machine.

The electronics are simple: a Xiao esp32c3 microcontroller, an addressable LED strip, and a power button.
I might add a LiPo battery using the built in LiPo battery charging circuit.

I also made an iOS app to control the lamp from my iPhone using SwiftUI.
